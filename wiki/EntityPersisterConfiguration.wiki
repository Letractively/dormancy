#summary Configuring entity persisters individually

= !EntityPersister Configuration =

Every `EntityPersister` (even `Dormancy` itself) might have an `EntityPersisterConfiguration` that contains the various configuration options for changing the behaviour massively.

|| *Option*						|| *Default Value*	|| *Description*																						||
|| `saveNewEntities`			|| `false`			|| Enables saving of new Hibernate entities without identifier											||
|| `checkVersion`				|| `true`			|| Enables version checking for Hibernate entities														||
|| `flushAutomatically`			|| `false`			|| Automatically flushes the current session after cloning												||
|| `cloneObjects`				|| `false`			|| Enables cloning of objects instead of modifying them													||
|| `createEmptyCollections`		|| `true`			|| Creates new empty collections when cloning entities with uninitialized persistent collections		||

*Note that the first option is fully supported but enabling them may lead to unexpected results and some side-effects may be difficult to discover. Use them with care!*
