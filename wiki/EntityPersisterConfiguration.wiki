#summary Configuring entity persisters individually

= !EntityPersister Configuration =

Every `EntityPersister` (even `Dormancy` itself) might have an `EntityPersisterConfiguration` that contains the various configuration options for changing the behaviour massively.

|| *Option*						|| *Default Value*	|| *Description*																						||
|| `deleteRemovedEntities`		|| `false`			|| Permanently deletes removed entities from collections												||
|| `saveNewEntities`			|| `false`			|| Enables saving of new Hibernate entities without identifier											||
|| `saveAssociationsProperties`	|| `false`			|| Enables saving of dirty properties of associations (similar to JPAÂ´s `javax.persistence.CascadeType`)||
|| `versionChecking`			|| `true`			|| Enables version checking for Hibernate entities														||
|| `skipTransient`				|| `true`			|| Skips fields declared `transient`																	||
|| `skipFinal`					|| `true`			|| Skips fields declared `final`																		||

*Note that the first three options are fully supported but enabling them may lead to unexpected results and some side-effects may be difficult to discover. Use them with care!*
