== How do I contribute, give feedback, fix bugs and so on? ==

The Dormancy project really needs and appreciates any contributions, including documentation help, source code and feedback.
Suggested changes should come in the form of source code and/or very detailed and constructive feedback.

Bugs and other issues can be posted here: [http://code.google.com/p/dormancy/issues/list Issues]
