#summary  How to get Dormancy

= Getting Dormancy =
Depending on the build system used by the project, there are several possibilities of how to integrate Dormancy.

== Using Dormancy in a Maven project ==
This is the most recommended option because Dormancy is a Maven project aswell.
Thus by adding the Maven Repository to the project, the latest version of Dormancy can be obtained automatically.
Therefore, the the following repository definition has to be added to the `pom.xml`:
{{{
<repositories>
	...
	<repository>
		<id>dormancy.googlecode.com</id>
		<name>Dormancy Repository</name>
		<url>https://dormancy.googlecode.com/svn/m2/repository/</url>
	</repository>
</repositories>
}}}

Dormancy supports Hibernate 3.X and Hibernate 4.X.
Depending on the used Hibernate version, the appropriate dependency has toe be added to the `pom.xml`:
{{{
<dependencies>
	...
	<dependency>
		<groupId>at.schauer.gregor.dormancy</groupId>
		<artifactId>dormancy-hibernate3</artifactId>
		<version>1.1.0</version>
	</dependency>
</dependencies>
}}}
*or*
{{{
<dependencies>
	...
	<dependency>
		<groupId>at.schauer.gregor.dormancy</groupId>
		<artifactId>dormancy-hibernate4</artifactId>
		<version>1.1.0</version>
	</dependency>
</dependencies>
}}}
Even if Hibernate 4 is not fully compatible to Hibernate 3, those modules can simply become exchanged by replacing `dormancy-hibernate3` by `dormancy-hibernate4` or the other way round.
The `dormancy-core` module and all required dependencies are included automatically.

However, a project contains several complex Hibernate entities that require custom serialization logic, it is recommended to add the `dormancy-closure` module, which contains `ContextFunction` and other helpful classes supporting quick extensions.
Further information about how to customize Dormancy can be found in the chapters [ContextFunction Using ContextFunctions] and [CustomEntityPersisters Custom EntityPersisters].
{{{
<dependency>
	<groupId>at.schauer.gregor.dormancy</groupId>
	<artifactId>dormancy-closure</artifactId>
	<version>1.1.0</version>
</dependency>
}}}

== Building Dormancy from scratch ==
The latest source code of Dormancy can be downloaded from the SVN repository by invoking the following command:
{{{svn checkout http://dormancy.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ dormancy-read-only}}}
Please refer to the following page for further information about [https://code.google.com/p/dormancy/source/checkout checking out the source code].

The project can be built with Maven by typing the following command:
{{{mvn -P hibernate3 install}}}
or
{{{mvn -P hibernate4 install}}}

For executing the supplied JUnit tests, the `test` Maven profile has to be activated in addition to the `hibernate*` profile:
{{{mvn -P hibernate3,test install}}}

Optionally, JAR files containing the source code and the Javadoc can be built by invoking the appropriate Maven plugins:
{{{mvn -P hibernate3 source:jar javadoc:jar install}}}
