== General ==

=== I have a Maven project. Which modules do I need? ===
You basically need `hibernate3` or `hibernate4`
{{{
<dependency>
	<groupId>at.schauer.gregor.dormancy</groupId>
	<artifactId>hibernate3</artifactId>
	<version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
}}}
or
{{{
<dependency>
	<groupId>at.schauer.gregor.dormancy</groupId>
	<artifactId>hibernate3</artifactId>
	<version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
}}}
The `core` module and all required dependencies are included automatically.

=== I do not have a Maven project. Which JARs do I need? ===
You can simply download `dormancy-1.0.0_dist.zip` from the [http://code.google.com/p/dormancy/downloads/list Downloads] section.
It contains all modules (use either `hibernate3` or `hibernate4`) as well as all dependencies.

=== Which JPA providers are supported? ===
Currently Dormancy supports only Hibernate 3 and Hibernate 4.
There are no plans to support other JPA providers in the near future.
However, if you plan to adapt Dormancy to support another JPA implementation or persistence framework, please let me know.

== Spring ==

=== Why does Dormancy require many Spring modules? ===
Spring provides many aspect oriented utility classes for beans.
Thus it is a logical consequence to make use of them instead of providing proprietary mechanisms.
Furthermore, it is very likely that a dependency injection framework is used for wiring the business logic together.
However, Dormancy does not force you to use Spring as your IoC container.
