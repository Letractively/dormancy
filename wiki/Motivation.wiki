#summary Reasons for Dormancy

= Motivation =

Dormancy is a framework that supports transparent exposure of attached Hibernate entities to GWT clients as well as merging new or detached entities back to the database.
The idea for developing Dormancy emerged due to the fact that the development of its predecessor, namely Gilead, stopped more than one year ago.
Dormancy provides a modular and extensible architecture guaranteeing easy modifications.
